<h2 id="open-water-swim-tracking-app"><strong>Open Water Swim Tracking App</strong></h2>

<p>I developed this project as part of the graduation steps of the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801" target="_blank"><strong>Android Development Nanodegree</strong></a> course (designed by Google and Udacity).</p>

<p>App design follows the course project “rubric”, with <strong>requirements related to the implementation of many important Android framework features</strong> (like Activities, Services, Loaders, AsynchTasks, Widgets, Google Firebase Authentication and Real-time Database, Material Design UI, etc.).  <br>
The app also uses well known Android libraries like AndroidAnnotations, GSon, Picasso and GraphView.</p>

<p>The app is a <strong>swim training utility to</strong> <strong>keep track of open water swimming</strong>. Common features are:</p>

<ol>
<li>By the <strong>watch module</strong>: keep track of open water swimming sessions by recording swim length, duration, GPS coordinates of points</li>
<li>By the <strong>phone module</strong>: manually record user feedback about marine weather conditions like flow, waves and perceived temperature</li>
<li>List swim sessions</li>
<li>Present swimming performance in a graph displayed by an Home Screen widget</li>
<li>Backup and restore swim sessions on Google Firebase cloud service</li>
<li>Present news about the “open water swim world” coming from external service</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that the google-services.json file is not published on this repository, so to build the app you must add your own (related to your Google Cloud service account)</p>

<p><strong>Design Note:</strong> unfortunately the development process could not involve a graphic designer, so even implementing some of the Material Design specs, the look and feel of the app is quite basic.</p>
